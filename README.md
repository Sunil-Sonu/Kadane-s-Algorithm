# Kadane-Algorithm
Kadane's algorithm consists of a scan through the array values, computing at each position the maximum (positive sum) subarray ending at that position. This subarray is either empty (in which case its sum is zero) or consists of one more element than the maximum subarray ending at the previous position. The algorithm only needs to keep track of the ending position because the implied starting position is just after the last position at which the sum went negative; a higher sum can always be found by dropping any negative-sum prefix.
